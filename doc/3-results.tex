\subsection{Analysis}
The mean for the static condition is $0.6051$ and the mean for the dynamic condition is $0.8354$.
Shapiro-Wilk test for both the static and dynamic data is not significant ($p = 0.0776$ and $p = 0.0592$ respectively), which means that a independent sample t-test can be performed. %when I have 6000 samples this becomes 0.1818 and 0.1192
The indepedent sample t-test showed that the data is significantly different ($p = 0.00006335$).
This means that the hypothesis that sexual reproduction is more advantageous than asexual reproduction in a faster changing environment can be accepted under this experiment.
